# mfem-mgis-data

This repository provides user oriented material for the external `mfem-mgis` [repository](https://github.com/thelfer/mfem-mgis).
You will find here meshes and a collection of use cases for the `mfem-mgis` library.


## Test case description

| Name | Description | Directory
|--|--|--|
| TODO | TODO | ex1 |

| Satoh  | Modelling plate of length 1 in plane strain clamped on the left and right boundaries and submitted to a parabolic thermal gradient along the x-axis | ex5 |
| Rve-elastic  | Simulation of a Representative Volume Element (RVE) with a non-linear elastic behavior law. A geometry mesh is provided : "inclusions_49.geo". The mesh can be generated using the following command: gmsh -3 `inclusions_49.geo`. By modifying the parameters within the `.geo` file, such as the number of spheres and the size of the element mesh, you can control and customize the simulation accordingly  | ex6 |
