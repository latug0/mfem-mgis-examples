abstract:

The MFEM-MGIS-MFront library (MMM) aims at efficiently use supercomputers in the field of implicit nonlinear thermomechanics. Our primary focus is to develop advanced nuclear fuel element simulations where the evolution of materials under irradiation are influenced by multiple phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, damage, phase transitions, swelling due to solid and gaseous fission products. MFEM constitutes the pilar for providing: finite elements abstractions, AMR handling and parallel API. However, as applications dedicated to solid mechanics in MFEM are mostly limited to a few constitutive equations such as elasticity and hyperelasticity, we felt the need to extend functionalites to cover a broader spectrum of mechanics. Thus, MMM project is combining MFEM with the MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport (MGIS), an open-source C++ library that provides convenient data structures to support arbitrarily complex nonlinear constitutive equations generated by the MFront code generator. MMM  is developed within the scope of the PLEIADES project in our organization.

The talk will be divided into four parts as follows:
1) A general introduction describing the main goals of MMM.
2) A short tutorial introducing MMM usage, with a focus on the high-level user interface (e.g. main aspects related to parallelism are hidden by default).
3) An overview of the core design choices of MMM and how MFEM was extended to support:
  - multi-materials, partial quadrature functions to store the materials internal state variables;
  - code generation for residual assembly at the element level;
  - naming of the mesh attributes;
  - standard mechanics post-processing to export stress and strain fields.
4) A feed-back on the two main issues that we encountered during the development of MMM:
  - handling failure of the constitutive law integration and running a fallback method;
  - treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions that possibly leads to initial estimates of the displacement field (main unknown), comprising highly deformed elements near the boundary.
