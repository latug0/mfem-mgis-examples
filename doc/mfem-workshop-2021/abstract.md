# Abstract

## Introduction

The MFEM-MGIS-MFront library (MMM) aims at efficiently use supercomputers in the field of implicit nonlinear thermomechanics. Our primary focus is to develop advanced nuclear fuel element simulations where the evolution of materials under irradiation are influenced by multiple phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, damage, phase transitions, swelling due to solid and gaseous fission products. MFEM constitutes the pilar for providing: finite elements abstractions, AMR handling and parallel API. However, as applications dedicated to solid mechanics in MFEM are mostly limited to a few constitutive equations such as elasticity and hyperelasticity, we felt the need to extend functionalites to cover a broader spectrum of mechanics. Thus, MMM project is combining MFEM with the MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport (MGIS), an open-source C++ library that provides convenient data structures to support arbitrarily complex nonlinear constitutive equations generated by the MFront code generator. MMM  is developed within the scope of the PLEIADES project in our organization.

## Outline of the talk

The talk will be divided into four parts as follows:
1) A general introduction describing the main goals of MMM.
2) A short tutorial introducing MMM usage, with a focus on the high-level user interface (e.g. main aspects related to parallelism are hidden by default).
3) An overview of the core design choices of MMM and how MFEM was extended to support:
  - multi-materials, partial quadrature functions to store the materials internal state variables;
  - code generation for residual assembly at the element level;
  - naming of the mesh attributes;
  - standard mechanics post-processing to export stress and strain fields.
4) A feed-back on the two main issues that we encountered during the development of MMM:
  - handling failure of the constitutive law integration and running a fallback method;
  - treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions that possibly leads to initial estimates of the displacement field (main unknown), comprising highly deformed elements near the boundary.


<!-- ## API and main functionalities -->

<!-- The main high-level user interface of MFEM-MGIS allows simplifying the -->
<!-- setting of a mini-application. Parallelism management is mostly hidden -->
<!-- behind an API that focuses on mechanics. Each simulation begins with -->
<!-- the initialization of finite elements and loading a mesh, but the the -->
<!-- MFEM mechanics is completly automated. Then the constitutive equations -->
<!-- and material characteristics are loaded through MGIS machinery with -->
<!-- some simple to use methods. A management of advanced boundary -->
<!-- conditions is proposed. Standard mechanics post-processing methods are -->
<!-- provided through export function for fields such as strain and -->
<!-- stress. We have to mention that quadrature points are very important -->
<!-- in the case of the nonlinear mechanics as the material behavior is -->
<!-- evaluated at each of these points. Furthermore, internal variables, -->
<!-- stress and strain are defined also at quadrature points. Thus, much -->
<!-- information are exchanged between MFEM and MGIS at these location. In -->
<!-- multi-material modelling, depending on the part of the mesh, different -->
<!-- materials with specific characteristics and constitutive equations are -->
<!-- set. This implies that specific fields, linked to materials, live on -->
<!-- only part of the mesh, which implies to design specific data -->
<!-- structures and ability to define functions at quadrature points that -->
<!-- depends heavility on material identifier. -->


<!-- ## Main difficulties -->

<!-- Behaviour integrators managed by MGIS/MFront are meant to: compute the -->
<!-- gradients from unknowns, handle the state variables, call the -->
<!-- behaviour integration, compute the stiffness matrix. The MFront code -->
<!-- generator produces optimized C code that can be interated through -->
<!-- shared library in a host application such as MFEM. The assembly -->
<!-- process of the stifnness matrix handled by MGIS/MFront can typically -->
<!-- lead in some case to linear system too difficult for the considered -->
<!-- time step. A first issue that we encountered is the fact that -->
<!-- typically the nonlinear solver proposed by MFEM does not provide easy -->
<!-- way to deal with a failure of the linear solve, which is commonplace -->
<!-- for our setting. Thus, MFEM-MGIS proposes a new nonlinear solver that -->
<!-- recovers from difficulties encountered during linear solve. -->
